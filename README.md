## Installation
  First download the code for the application from my repo. This app requires node.js to run, and npm-inquirer as well. Download node.js from their official website and install it. Then, in the repo/program folder, open terminal and run "npm install inquirer" to get inquirer. This is all you need to run the program!

## Usage
  Once you have prequisites installed, to run the application simply open terminal from the repo/program parent folder. (The folder that this readme is found in!). In the terminal, you can verify you are in the correct folder with command "ls" and if you see a list of files and folders including file "index" you're in the right spot! Type "node index" and the app will start running! Answer the prompts, these will generate a card for each employee!
